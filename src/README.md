# Horse-Racing-Prediction-Application
<h3> PROJECT OVERVIEW </h3>

<b>Horse racing</b> is one of the most ancient of all sports. Horse races vary widely in format and many countries have developed their own particular traditions around the sport. A race is to identify which of two or more horses is the fastest over a set course and distance. Horse racing in Japan is a popular equestrian sport, with more than 21,000 horse races held each year. With horse racing data from the Japanese website, you have the challenge to find information from these data and to build a model that predicts the three fastest horses in a race using data analysis and machine learning.

<h3> WHY THIS PROJECT </h3>

Before a race starts, there are many people buying a ticket for betting. They bet for a horse based on their knowledge or race’s expert. Betting on horse racing is notoriously difficult and is considered by many speculators to be uncrackable. People question whether the machine is able to predict the horse’s order in a race. Using all data science skills you will answer this question.

<h3> Application </h3>
Build a predictive model that predicts the three fastest horses (in any order) in a race, criteria for <b>all races from 2018</b> to now with the true positive horses <b>at least 49.3%</b>. Then, implement a restful API to upload new race information and return the prediction result. The input for API is a new race folder that contains all files data of a race and the output is csv file that indicates which horses are in the top three fastest horses.
